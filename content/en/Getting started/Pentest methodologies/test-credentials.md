You would not share a user account with someone who is trying to break into your system.
However, best practice for pentests assume that a black-hat hacker has somehow gained
access to a valid account.

Our pentests therefore require that you set up dedicated accounts for **each** of our
pentesters with appropriate privileges and permissions. While you're welcome to use
our software to share these credentials, you can also use the encryption software of
your choice.

When you share information on the dedicated accounts:

- Describe the user role along with associated permissions and/or privileges.
- Other requirements such as two-factor authentication (2FA)

Before sharing this information, make sure the account works.
