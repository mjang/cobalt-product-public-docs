You may have unique requirements and concerns, especially about assets in production use.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

You've already shared details about your asset, ideally including its architecture (and other things, include link)
Beyond the standards, you should share any or all special concerns about the asset. The following
checklist includes examples to help you decide what to share with your pentesters. While there's
no requirement to include any of these details, we encourage you to include concerns, especially
if they affect any of your production systems.

- Highlight areas for special attention, such as:
  - Recent releases
  - Specific functionality
- Vulnerabilities that you're concerned about
  - Be specific. Include CVE numbers (or equivalent) if available.
- Requirements to access the target environment:
  - For example, if you're looking for a test on the internal network, include instructions on
    how to access the [jumpbox](../glossary#jumpbox) on that network.
- Production concerns. If you're setting up a test on production systems, share details that could affect
  your network.
- Out-of-scope subjects. Highlight any features or workflows that are out of scope for this test.
  - **We do not recommend having an out of scope list.**
