Overview of test methodologies for Web assets. Includes microservices.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the section(s) associated with your asset(s).

## Web

The Cobalt team of pentesters do not need access to the underlying web application source code,
unless you specify it as a requirement.

Tests of a Web asset include tests of APIs used to populate content on that asset. If you
have additional APIs, you may consider setting up:

- A combined Web + API test
- A separate test for APIs

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OWASP Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS) and Testing Guide. Our team takes the following steps to ensure
full coverage:

- Target scope reconnaissance
- Business and application logic mapping
- Automated web crawling and web scanner configuration tweaking
- Automated vulnerability scanning
  - Manual crawling to ensure better coverage
- Manual web vulnerability tests and exploit reviews
  - Also covers microservices 
- Ongoing assessments
  - Report results to clients through the platform
- Report, triage, and retest
