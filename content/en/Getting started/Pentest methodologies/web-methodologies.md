We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the section(s) associated with your asset(s).

## Web

The Cobalt team of pentesters do not need access to the underlying web application source code,
unless you specify it as a requirement.

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OWASP Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS) and Testing Guide. Our team takes the following steps to ensure
full coverage:

- Target scope reconnaissance
- Business and application logic mapping
- Automated web crawling and web scanner configuration tweaking
- Automated vulnerability scanning
  - Manual crawling to ensure better coverage
- Manual web vulnerability tests and exploit reviews
  - Also covers microservices 
- Ongoing assessments
  - Report results to clients through the platform
- Report, triage, and retest
  - Requires tests of at least two (2) credits
