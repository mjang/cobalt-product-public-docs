Some detail requirements vary by the type of asset.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Our pentests have common requirements for all assets, as well as requirements for
specific assets. 

Pentest requirements for Web and API assets are identical. However, 
tests of a Web asset include tests of APIs used to populate content on that asset.

The Details page of the pentest wizard requests information about:

- The target environment
- For cloud providers, whether authorization is needed

## Common Pentest Requirements

All of our pentests share the characteristics listed in this section:

### Network Information

Our pentesters send requests from one or more of the following IP addresses:

- 35.185.178.3
- 35.198.53.81
- 104.198.99.165
- 104.199.55.175

### Environment

We need to know the environment of the pentest asset. The standard options are:

- Production (Serves end-users)
- Staging (Proposed future production environment)
- Development (App in work; may not be fully tested)

If you define your environment differently, let us know. In the UI, you can do so
in comments.

### Test Data

Our pentesters also need information on test data. If your apps contain:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Credit-card holder data (CHD)

Our pentesters will take extra care to protect that information.
<!-- Is this true? -->

Some apps support the use of credit cards for purchases. If you provide
test credit card numbers, you can share that information in the 
instructions [provide link] or in the "Kickoff call".
