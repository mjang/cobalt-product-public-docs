## Asset

For pentesting, an asset is a software component of value. Cobalt can perform pentests on assets in the
following categories:

{{% asset-categories %}}

## Mobile Screen

A mobile screen is what you see on a mobile device, such as an iPhone or an Android system. As
described by [Codepath](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Mobile-Screen-Archetypes), mobile 
screens fall into several archetypes. 

You may have multiple screens of an archtype. For example, you may have 10 mobile screens for
the onboarding archtype.

## Dynamic Page

Web applications typically include _static_ and _dynamic_ web pages. A Dynamic Page includes content
that can be customized, either through an application server (server-side) or through code such as
JavaScript running in the browser (client-side).

## User Role

A User Role specifies the permissions or privileges associated with a user. Common examples of User Roles include:

- Global Administrator (such as a UNIX root user)
- Administrator
- Group Owner
- Workspace Administrator
- Full User
- Guest

This is not a comprehensive list. When scoping an Asset, it's important to include a complete number of user roles. If you miss a user role, you may sacrifice quality in penetration testing.
