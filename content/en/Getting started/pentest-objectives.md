Explain expectations for your pentesters.

In this section, you can lay out objectives for your pentesters. This is
part of the Cobalt process to set up a new pentest.

You can use this page as a checklist. Once complete, you'll be ready to
help your pentester understand key details of your software.

## Target(s)

Specify a target for your pentesters. For most asset types, that should be one (or more) of
the following:

- URL(s) for the associated app or API
- IP addresses (or address ranges) for an external/internal network
- Link to the (mobile) app from a source such as the Apple App Store or Google Play 

## Methodology

In general, this should be fixed. For example, if your asset type is API (only) the
methodology should be fixed as API.

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
Tests of Web assets include tests of APIs used to directly supply data to that asset. For
example, if a dynamic web page includes APIs 
{{% /alert %}}

## Objective(s)

We have standard objectives for all pentests:

- Coverage of OWASP Top 10
- ASVS

We encourage you to add objectives based on your use cases. If you do, please add as much
information as possible about your requirements, to help our pentesters focus their efforts.

## Technology Stack

To help ensure that you get pentesters who are best qualified to test your asset,
you need to specify details associated with the technology stack used to build
your software. That stack varies by the type of asset:

### Web

When building a web application, you may use one or more of the following programming languages:

- Java
- JavaScript framework <!-- source: https://hackr.io/blog/best-javascript-frameworks -->
  - Angular
  - React
  - Node
  - Vue
- Go
- .NET
- PHP
- Python   
- Ruby

These are some of the more common examples. If your web application is built with a different
language(s), list them. Your pentester needs to know.

In addition, dynamic web sites may pull information from databases. You want a pentester whose
familiar with the weaknesses of languages such as:

- SQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Oracle
  - MySQL
  - MSSQL
- noSQL
- CockroachDB
- MongoDB

### Mobile

For some, mobile apps are an extension of web apps. If you have a dedicated mobile app, your
pentester needs to know what language was used to develop that app. 

In many cases, you may have used one of the [Web](#web) app languages. You may have also used
one of the languages that are designed for mobile apps, including:

- Swift
- Objective C
- Kotlin
- Dart

### API

An API, short for an Application Programming Interface, specifies how apps communicate with
each other. Most APIs are associated with one of the following three technologies:

- RESTful APIs
- GraphQL
- Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) <!-- Do we even support testing in SOAP? --> 

The technology drives the commands used to access data. And API testing also depends on
the programming language used to set it up. In general, you may use one or more of the
same programming languages used to create [Web](#web) or [Mobile](#mobile) apps.

### Internal Network / External Network

The technologies associated with internal and external networks relate mostly to hardware
components, including:

- Routers
- Switches
- Firewalls
- Load Balancers
- Proxy Servers

If you're looking for a test of an internal or an external network, it's also helpful to
include:

- A hardware diagram which depicts connections on your network

You can add this information to your asset, as described in
[Plan Your Assets](../#plan-your-assets).

### Cloud Configuration

We can help users test their cloud configurations by service. In general, cloud configuration
services correspond to services that may be installed on internal servers. But the key element
here is the Technology Stack.

In this case, cloud configuration technology stacks correspond to the services that you might
purchase from a cloud provider such as Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. To help you list the
right cloud configuration technology stack, we provide this list of examples:

- APIs
- VPNs
- S3 Guckets
- Databases (SQL, RDMS)
- Remote Desktops
- Virtual Machines

## Target

Pentesters work on targets. You should collect the domains and IP address ranges when listing
objectives, such as:

- https://www.example.com:3333
- 192.168.0.0/24

## Methodology

<!-- source: https://docs.google.com/document/d/171hWrRcSII-W8oUrERXiDJsdD56NivBz79oslbSndiU/edit#  --> 

In general, the methodology used for pentesting corresponds to the type of asset. If you've set up
an asset of multiple types, you can ask our pentesters to focus on a specific methodology. For
example, if you've set up a "Web + API" asset, you can choose from three pre-set methodologies:

- Web + API
- Web
- API

For more information on the objectives associated with our methodologies, see our sections related to
[Pentest Objectives]("./Pentest methodologies/#detailed-instructions"). 

## Objective(s)

We have a set of standard objectives for each methodology. They include one or more of the following:

- Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual
  - [PDF](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf), 213 pages
  - Describes a process to prevent opponents from accessing sensitive information.
    Commonly used by government and military agencies. Focused on
    [OpSec](../glossary#operational-security-opsec).
- OWASP [Top 10 Web Application Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
  - Subject to change.
- OWASP [API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/)
<!-- Need confirmation, as this varies from what's shown in the UI -->
  - Subject to change.
- OWASP [Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/)
<!-- Need confirmation, as this varies from what's shown in the UI -->
  - Subject to change.
- OWASP [Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
- [Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM 3)](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf)
  - 200 page PDF
- [CIS Controls from the Center for Internet Security, version 8](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/)
  - Formerly known as the SANS Top 20.

If you haven't done so already, include the application logic in the asset description discussed
in [Plan Your Assets](../plan-assets).
